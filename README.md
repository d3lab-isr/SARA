[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/200732261.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/200732261)

## 0. About Substance Abuse Research Assistant (SARA)

"SARA is a mobile application to increase or sustain engagement of substance data collection overtime." (Rabbi and others, 2018) A micro-randomized trial (MRT) was conducted to assess the effectiveness of employing various engagement strategies integrated with the mobile application.
